## Challenges and Learning Opportunities  

**Error handling**  
 
    - Used recursion to get the generatePassword function to restart when certain conditions weren't met. However, I had trouble figuring out how to prevent the first function call from continuing to run. I realized that using a return on the recursive function call was the solution.  
    - Capturing all the conditions where user input something other than a number between 8 & 128. I learned about the unary plus operator which turns user input into a number. I was able to use isNan to reject any non-numeric characters.

**Click to copy**  

    - Learned about the JavaScript Clipboard API  
    - Was able to create a function where user can click the password text to copy it to their clipboard
